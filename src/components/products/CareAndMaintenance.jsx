        Swarovski crystal is a delicate material that must be handled with
        special care. To ensure that your Swarovski product remains in the best
        possible condition over an extended period of time, please observe the
        advice below to avoid damage: <br />
        <br />
        <H7>Jewelry & Watches:</H7> <br />
        Store your jewelry in the original packaging or a soft pouch to avoid
        scratches.
        <br />
        Avoid contact with water. <br />
        Remove jewelry before washing hands, swimming, and/or applying products
        (e.g. perfume, hairspray, soap, or lotion), as this could harm the metal
        and reduce the life of the plating, as well as cause discoloration and
        loss of crystal brilliance. Avoid hard contact (i.e. knocking against
        objects) that can scratch or chip the crystal. <br />
        <br />
        <H7>Figurines & Decorative Objects: </H7> <br />
        Polish your product carefully with a soft, lint free cloth or clean it
        by hand with lukewarm water. Do not soak your crystal products in water.{" "}
        <br />
        Dry with a soft, lint free cloth to maximize brilliance. <br />
        Avoid contact with harsh, abrasive materials and glass/window cleaners.{" "}
        <br />
        When handling your crystal, it is advisable to wear cotton gloves to
        avoid leaving fingerprints. <br />
